# PortMiner
PortMiner allows you to create Minecraft servers without manually port forwarding, or Hamachi.

As of PortMiner 4.4, you can also run other servers that are set up manually, by setting run-server to false in portminer.properties, and specifying the port and protocol in the same configuration.
